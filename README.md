# Determining Visual Thresholds Between Numbers

## Overview

A research project on how individuals perceive figures differently using linear algebra, k-randomness estimation, and survey analysis

The goal of this study is to determine how individuals view two numbers, 1 and 7, when they are manipulated to look 

## Methodology
- Built a linear scaling system to differentiate distances between figures appearing as a respective number
- Performed **matrix transformations** to vertically shear and displace linear equations for two separate figures
- Used a **k-randomness estimation** to create an unbiased survey for human data collection
- Analyzed results through a **threshold distribution** to determine when individuals view change

## Results
-
