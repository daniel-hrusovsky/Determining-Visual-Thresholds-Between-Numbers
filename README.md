# Determining Visual Thresholds Between Numbers

## Overview

A research project on how individuals perceive figures differently using linear algebra, k-randomness estimation, and survey analysis

The goal of this study is to determine how individuals view two numbers, 1 and 7, when they are manipulated to look 

Data comes from 225 survey results [(Preview Survey Here)](https://johncarroll.pdx1.qualtrics.com/jfe/preview/previewId/dd7d9313-d1bb-4944-abad-99e26c196445/SV_4VMTY3OcaneSidU?Q_CHL=preview&Q_SurveyVersionID=current)

## Methodology
- Built a linear scaling system to differentiate distances between figures appearing as a respective number
- Performed **matrix transformations** to vertically shear and displace linear equations for two separate figures
- Used a **k-randomness estimation** to create an unbiased survey for human data collection
- Analyzed results through a **threshold distribution** to determine when individuals view change

## Results
- Determined that the initial figure is frequently seen as a **1**
- Determined that the second figure is frequently seen as a **7**

## Applications
- This project can be used on other individualized concepts, such as color or sound
- A larger-scale project could benefit machine learning models in deciphering number and letter differentiation
